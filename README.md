##  My first programm ist just a simple user login that asks for a username and a password, 
   if one of those two is incorrect or unknown to the code it will show the user some message,
   if correct it print out "hello ____".
        At first I set up the main structure of the code and due to my lack of experience i quickly ran into some problems. 
        The indendations weren't correct and the lines missed correct pythonian interpunctuation, after a little while I fixed those errors
        and got the program running.
